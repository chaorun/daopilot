# daopilot

daopilot is a framework for building DAOPHOT photometry pipelines in Python. This project has been abandoned mid-refactor, so the repository is left here for posterity, but is in disarray.

daopilot is absolutely not endorsed by P. B. Stetson (HIA). To obtain the DAOPHOT source code itself, contact P. B. Stetson.
